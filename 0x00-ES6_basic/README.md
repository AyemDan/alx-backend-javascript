## Learning ES6 Fundamentals

This project is designed to guide you through the core concepts of ES6 (ECMAScript 2015), a significant update to the JavaScript language that introduced valuable features to enhance code readability, maintainability, and expressiveness.

### Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you'll be able to confidently explain the following to anyone, without external references:

- **Understanding ES6:** What it is and its impact on JavaScript development.
- **ES6 Features:** Exploring the new functionalities introduced in ES6, including:
    - Constants and Variables: The distinction between `const` and `let` declarations, and their scoping implications.
    - Block-Scoped Variables: How variables declared within code blocks (`{}`) are confined to that scope.
    - Arrow Functions: Concise syntax for defining functions, with implicit return for single-expression functions and automatic parameter binding.
    - Rest and Spread Parameters: Efficient ways to handle multiple arguments and spread existing arrays or objects into function calls.
    - String Templating: Cleaner string manipulation using template literals (` backticks `).
    - Object Creation and Properties: Flexible object creation methods (e.g., object destructuring, computed property names) and property shorthand syntax.
    - Iterators and for-of Loops: Iterating over iterable objects using the `for-of` loop and leveraging iterators.

### Requirements

**Environment:**

- Operating System: Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
- Node.js Version: 12.11.x

**Editors:**

- Choose one of these code editors: vi, vim, emacs, Visual Studio Code

**Code Formatting:**

- All files should end with a newline character.

**File Structure:**

- Include a `README.md` file at the project root.
- Use the `.js` extension for your code files.

**Testing:**

- We'll be using the Jest Testing Framework to ensure the correctness of your code.

**Linting:**

- ESLint will be used to analyze your code and enforce specific coding style guidelines that we'll provide.

**Function Exports:**

- All functions within your code must be exported using appropriate methods.

**Additional Notes:**

- Feel free to consult the official ES6 documentation for further in-depth information: [invalid URL removed]
