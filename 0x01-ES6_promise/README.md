# Promises, Async/Await, and Error Handling in JavaScript

## Resources

Before diving into this project, you may find it helpful to explore the following resources:

- **Promises**: Understanding how JavaScript handles asynchronous operations with Promises.
- [JavaScript Promise: An Introduction](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/promises)
- **Await**: Learn how the `await` keyword works within asynchronous functions.
- **Async**: Deep dive into the `async` keyword and how it simplifies handling asynchronous code.
- **Throw / Try**: Error handling using `try`, `catch`, and `throw`.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts:

- **Promises**:
  - What they are and why they are important.
  - How to use the `.then()`, `.resolve()`, and `.catch()` methods.
  - How to utilize every method of the Promise object.
  
- **Error Handling**:
  - How to effectively use `throw` and `try` for catching and managing errors in JavaScript.

- **Async/Await**:
  - How to use the `await` operator within asynchronous functions.
  - How to write and structure `async` functions to simplify Promise-based code.

## Requirements

To successfully work on this project, the following requirements must be met:

- All files will be executed on **Ubuntu 18.04 LTS** using **NodeJS 12.11.x**.
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`, `Visual Studio Code`.
- Every file must end with a **new line**.
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory.
- All files must have a `.js` extension.
- Code will be tested using **Jest** with the command: `npm run test`.
- Code will be linted using **ESLint**.
- All functions must be **exported** for use in other modules.

Happy coding!
